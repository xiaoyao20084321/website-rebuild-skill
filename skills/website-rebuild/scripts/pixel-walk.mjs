/**
 * pixel-walk.mjs — run the pixel gate at N scroll checkpoints, not one.
 *
 * ⛔ A single 0.00 is the most misleading number this toolchain produces. It is
 * one frame, usually the top of the page in the first couple of seconds, on a
 * document that may be tens of thousands of pixels tall — and §4.8 of
 * verification-gates.md exists because a whole suite once photographed one
 * state and reported the site correct.
 *
 * This drives both sides to the same scroll fraction before capturing, and
 * repeats. It is a thin loop over pixelcompare.mjs on purpose: the comparison,
 * the determinism shim, the non-empty-frame precondition and the
 * distinct-sides guard all stay in one place.
 *
 * ⚠ Establish the SELF-BAND at these same checkpoints first (--self on one
 * side). A cross-side number is only meaningful against the band: measured on
 * one target, the unfrozen self-band was 4.6-5.0 while the unfrozen cross-side
 * was 2.6-3.4 — the "difference" was entirely the page's own session noise, and
 * both numbers were useless until the shim brought the band to 0.00.
